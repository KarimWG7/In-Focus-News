      "description": "The UN climate summit in Brazil was a let down, proving that summitry cannot move at the speed that the climate crisis needs. Business must not wait for grand global consensus.

      "content": "This year’s United Nations climate summit in Belém, Brazil, ended last week. Countries made promises on paper and avoided hard decisions. Having gathered nearly 200 nations to chart out climate action, CoP-30 produced a ‘ Belém Political Package ’ that deferred questions rather than answer them. We should not pretend that this is progress. The core issue is simple. Countries could not agree on how or when to phase out fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for the climate crisis. They pledged to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion each year by 2035, but offered no timeline for delivery and no one to hold accountable for it. On trade and finance, the mechanisms that actually move capital, the summit produced nothing. Negotiators at the 2025 Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) moved these conversations into so-called ‘presidency consultations,’ which is diplomatic code for ‘later.’ This pattern has worn thin. The 2009 commitment of $100 billion in annual climate finance was never fully delivered. Now we are told to trust pledges of about $300 billion annually and a Baku-to-Belém Roadmap to mobilize $1.3 trillion. Without enforcement, these are merely hopes and not plans. And hope does not move capital, plans do. Business leaders watching from boardrooms have grown tired of this cycle. They have been promised clarity on fossil fuel timelines. But all they got was ambiguity. They have been promised frameworks to manage carbon tariffs and trade. What they got was silence. They have been promised accountability on financial commitments. Instead, they got vague targets and no one to hold responsible. Climate science tells a story that demands urgency. The World Resources Institute’s State of Climate Action 2025 report found that no sector is moving fast enough to keep planetary warming at safe levels. The Climate Action Tracker estimated that even if every country kept every climate pledge, the world would still warm by 2.3-2.5° Celsius above its pre-industrial level. Current policies point to 2.8° Celsius of global warming. The gap between commitments and outcomes is growing wider, not narrower. This should inform how businesses respond. Waiting for a consensus among 194 countries is a choice that no company should make. The climate does not negotiate, it acts. Businesses must do the same. Consider what is happening in practice. Private climate finance reached $1.3 trillion in 2023, driven by corporations, consumers and investors. Governments did not lead this shift; business and industry did. Renewable energy capacity is breaking records despite policy uncertainty. Electric vehicles are being deployed at scale without a globally integrated policy framework. This tells us something. Businesses do not need permission from summits to move. They need permission from their own pragmatic calculations. For India, this matters even more. The country faces a climate crisis that will not wait for global agreement. Heatwaves are intensifying, water is getting scarcer and farm yields are shifting. These are not future shocks. They are a clear and present danger that’s worsening. India’s renewable capacity exceeds 180 gigawatts. The country has met some of its climate targets five years early. It, however, still needs to build resilience into its economy at scale. Indian businesses cannot wait for the $310 billion in annual adaptation finance that the United Nations Environment Programme’s Adaptation Gap Report 2025 estimates developing countries need by 2035. That money may never fully arrive. Instead, companies dependent on agriculture, water or temperature-sensitive operations must invest in resilience themselves. For instance, they must fortify company infrastructure against heat and floods. Second, Indian businesses should act to diversify their supply chains across geographies. Relying on single regions or sectors leaves companies exposed to climate shocks that will worsen over time. Geography matters, supply chains matter and resilience comes from well-spread operations. Third, Indian industry should set standards within its own sectors without waiting for regulation. Industry groups can establish climate metrics and accountability systems. This creates pressure. It builds markets. It demonstrates what is possible. With or without a multilateral consensus, it is time to move ahead. There is nothing but risk in falling behind what science demands. The companies that treat climate adaptation as an operational necessity will gain an advantage over those that wait. Markets are shifting accordingly and supply chains are already forming. CoP-30 proved that summits cannot move at the speed that the climate requires. Businesses must not wait for a grand global agreement. The calculus is simple. Climate impacts will accelerate, regulatory costs will rise and supply chains will fracture. Companies that build resilience now can reduce these costs. They can secure their assets and help protect markets. India’s businesses should read the Belém outcome as a signal of an evolving situation that promises little certainty. The world cannot afford many more missed opportunities at UN climate summits. Businesses cannot afford to wait for agreement either.

      "content": "India's Q2 FY26 GDP Data To Be Released On Friday: According to estimates, the economic growth in July-September 2025 is likely to have grown between 7% and 7.5%. India’s Q2 GDP Data: The Indian economy continues to remain resilient despite a difficult global environment. The latest Q2 FY26 GDP growth data is set to be released at 4 pm on Friday, November 28. According to estimates, the economic growth in July-September 2025 is likely to have grown between 7% and 7.5%. Rating agencies ICRA and India Ratings have estimated Q2 FY26 GDP growth at 7% and 7.2%, respectively. SBI Research has pegged the economic growth at 7.5%. However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the economy to expand by 7% in July-September 2025. Aditi Nayar, chief economist and head of research & outreach at ICRA, said growth in Q2 has been boosted by manufacturing momentum tied to the early festive season, GST-driven volume pick-up and exporters front-loading shipments to the US before tariff deadlines. “A lower YoY rise in government spending is likely to weigh on the pace of the GDP and GVA growth in Q2 FY2026 compared to Q1 FY2026. However, inventory stocking related to the early onset of the festive season, enhanced by the GST-rationalisation induced volume pick-up, and upfronting of exports to the US ahead of the tariffs, are expected to boost the performance of the manufacturing sector, and help industry GVA growth outpace that of the services after a gap of four quarters,\" Nayar said. SBI Research in a report said growth is being supported by a pick-up in investment activities, recovery in rural consumption, and buoyancy in services and manufacturing, underpinned by structural reforms like GST rationalization that also helped unleash a festive spirit that decisively showcased triumph of hope over hype. “In continuum of the good numbers from festive led sales, percentage of leading indicators in consumption and demand across agriculture, industry, service sectors showing acceleration has increased to 83% in Q2 from 70% in Q1. Based on the estimated model, we obtain a nowcast of real GDP growth of 7.5% in Q2FY26 with possibility of an upside surprise,\" SBI said. It, however, said risks persist from volatile global commodity markets and potential spillovers from trade disruptions. Overall, India’s near-term outlook is strong, with macroeconomic stability providing space for sustained medium-term growth. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its ‘State of the Economy’ report on November 24 has cautioned that India’s economy showed signs of a further pick-up in momentum despite continuing global headwinds. The central bank stated that a robust expansion in both manufacturing and services activities in October, supported by ‘festive season demand and the ongoing positive impact of the GST reforms’. The RBI added that the inflation has moderated to a historic low and remained well below the target rate. Reuters’ Poll India’s economy likely grew 7.3% in the July-September quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists, underpinned by strong rural and government expenditure even as private capital spending remained subdued. Household consumption, which accounts for roughly 60% of the economy, strengthened in the previous quarter as rural spending improved on better agricultural output. Urban demand and private investment continued to lag, suggesting uneven growth in Asia’s third-largest economy. Government spending, a key driver of growth in recent years, also likely persisted in Q2 of this fiscal year. India remains one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, a move that has contributed to foreign investors pulling out a net $16 billion from Indian equities so far this year.",

      "content": "Mumbai, Nov 25 (PTI) Economist Sajjid Chinoy has pitched for a relook into the government's curb on foreign direct investments from China, arguing that allowing Chinese investments in the country will be more advantageous than slapping tariffs on imports from the northern neighbour. Chinoy, the chief India economist at J P Morgan, who is also a part-time member in the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), said that the private capital expenditure is down due to the lack of demand visibility amid the flood of cheaper Chinese imports. Chinese exports into the US were a free flowing river, but the 32 per cent tariff slapped by the Donald Trump administration is acting like a wall, leading to the same goods being spilled out into other emerging markets like India, he said. Speaking at an event organised by the Asia Society on Monday, Chinoy said the flood of Chinese goods at cheaper prices is creating challenges for emerging markets looking to increase their exports. \"I would argue India's corporate capex cycle has not picked up because you need much more domestic demand visibility. In a world in which Chinese imports are flooding in, creating disinflationary pressure, and you're starting to compete,\" he said. Pointing out to the impact of restrictions on foreign direct investment imposed by India in 2020 through \"press note 3\", Chinoy said that the trade deficit with China has widened to USD 115 billion from USD 50 billion in the last five years. In light of the \"thaw\" in relations between New Delhi and Beijing, Chinoy hoped for a \"political consensus\" is built to relook into the policy of restricting Chinese FDI, and made it clear that such a policy is \"counterproductive\". \"...rather than getting Chinese imports flooding us, why not get Chinese investment into India,\" he said, adding that such a move will create jobs locally and help the domestic economy. Pointing out that India needs a lot of intermediate goods from China, a \"manufacturing behemoth\", Chinoy further said, \"you'd rather have the value-add accruing in India than importing from China\". The remarks by the economist has come at a time when there are reports of a possible review of the \"press note 3\" that was introduced during the Covid pandemic. Concerns of sluggish private investments - which are deemed to begin a virtuous economic cycle - have also dominated for the last few years as the capex is led by the government. Referring to the oft repeated concerns on low research and development spends by Indian enterprises, Chinoy said the investments in innovation will continue to be lower if there are tariff barriers which are created, while an openness will lead to competition and hence, make such bets essential. \"If you're operating in a relatively closed market then the incentive to do so (spend in R&D) is not there,\" he said. In the face of artificial intelligence coming in, Chinoy advocated for more investments in advancing the human capital through efforts on education and skilling.",
